# ShoppingList_Python
This project is a Python implementation of a Shopping List system inspired by C++ class design.
It demonstrates key object-oriented concepts such as:
	•	Class design with private members
	•	Inheritance (e.g., FoodItem extends Item)
	•	Operator overloading (+= to add items to the shopping list)
	•	File I/O (saving and loading items)
	•	Mimicking C++-style restore and save functions
